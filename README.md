### Disclaimers
This does not follow team standards precisely (and in some cases not at all). Do not under any circumstances copy and paste code directly from this project without carefully ensuring that you aren't a) violating a convention and b) introducing a problem. Always read the code you copy.

This code is purely expiremental. I cannot and do not promise that it will run or run properly on an actual robot. It is entirely possible that parts of this project will simply not function or will reduce readability or structure.
